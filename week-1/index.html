            <h2> About Me</h2>
                <p>
                Hi there! My name is Shubham (he/they) and I am a fourth year at UCLA majoring in Public Affairs and minor in Global Studies.
                I was born in India but raised in San Diego, California! I want to spend my life focused on political organizing, research, and supporting grassroots movements.
                A fun fact about me is that I drink 5 liters of water everyday (hydration is important)!
                The following includes my three main goals as a critical digital map maker:
                <ul>
                    <li>to learn how to apply theoretical critiques of cartography to praxis</li>
                    <li>to understand how maps and GIS systems can be utilized to inspire social change</li>
                    <li>to utilize both quantitative data and qualitative data to inform public policy</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
