            <p>
            Hi there! My name is Shubham (he/they) and I am a fourth year at UCLA majoring in Public Affairs and minor in Global Studies.
            I was born in India but raised in San Diego, California! I want to spend my life focused on political organizing, research, and supporting grassroots movements.
            A fun fact about me is that I drink 5 liters of water everyday (hydration is important)!
            The following includes my three main goals as a critical digital map maker:
            <ol>
                <li>to learn how to apply theoretical critiques of cartography to praxis</li>
                <li>to understand how maps and GIS systems can be utilized to inspire social change</li>
                <li>to utilize both quantitative data and qualitative data to inform public policy</li>
            </ol>
